Kali_Mod_ShucksToday
====================

An install/mod script for Kali Linux. The idea is to be able to create semi-customized Kali installs quickly & easily by automating some of the basic setup tasks associated with Kali. This adds some stuff to Kali which will better suit it to various installations: laptop, desktop, server, mobile, & micro for now, but I'm also considering adding cracking & social configurations as well.

The .old version is a bunch of junk - it will be deleted as soon as I get done copying everything over.

NVidia driver stuff will have to remain incomplete until the winexe install doesn't bork /usr/bin2c. Hopefully somebody gets this worked out soon (or maybe I should get off my ass...).

This is an decent quality Alpha release but is slowly getting closer to Beta; your milage may vary.

Kali_Mod_ShucksToday
====================

An install/mod script for Kali Linux. This adds some stuff to Kali which will better suit it to various installations: laptop, desktop, server, & mobile for now.

The .old version is a bunch of junk - it will be deleted as soon as I get done copying everything over.

This is an Alpha release; your milage may vary.
